/**
 Amplitude iOS SDK.

 Use the Amplitude SDK to track events in your application.

 Setup:

 1. In every file that uses analytics, import Amplitude.h at the top `#import "Amplitude.h"`
 2. Be sure to initialize the API in your didFinishLaunchingWithOptions delegate `[[Amplitude instance] initializeApiKey:@"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"];`
 3. Track an event anywhere in the app `[[Amplitude instance] logEvent:@"EVENT_IDENTIFIER_HERE"];`
 4. You can attach additional data to any event by passing a NSDictionary object:

        NSMutableDictionary *eventProperties = [NSMutableDictionary dictionary];
        [eventProperties setValue:@"VALUE_GOES_HERE" forKey:@"KEY_GOES_HERE"];
        [[Amplitude instance] logEvent:@"Compute Hash" withEventProperties:eventProperties];

 **Note:** you should call SDK methods on an Amplitude instance, for example logging events with the default instance: `[[Amplitude instance] logEvent:@"testEvent"];`

 **Note:** the SDK supports tracking data to multiple Amplitude apps, via separate named instances. For example: `[[Amplitude instanceWithName:@"app1"] logEvent:@"testEvent"];` See [Tracking Events to Multiple Apps](https://github.com/amplitude/amplitude-ios#tracking-events-to-multiple-amplitude-apps).

 For more details on the setup and usage, be sure to checkout the [README](https://github.com/amplitude/Amplitude-iOS#amplitude-ios-sdk)
